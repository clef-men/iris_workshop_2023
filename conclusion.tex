\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{2em}
	\item
		Coq mechanization is available on \texttt{github} : \\
		\url{https://github.com/clef-men/caml5_alienation}
	\item
		Simplified Chase-Lev deque (one infinite array) \hfill \ding{51} \\
		Real-life Chase-Lev deque (multiple circular arrays) \hfill \ding{55}
	\item
		Proof looks more complex than the sketch.
		In particular, transitions between logical states are not really formalized.
	\item
		We plan to verify more primitives (\href{https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/domainslib}{Domainslib}, \href{https://github.com/taskflow/taskflow}{Taskflow}) based on Chase-Lev deque.
		This is thanks to modularity of \Iris specifications.
