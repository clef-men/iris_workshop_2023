\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{2em}
	\item
		Coq mechanization is available on \texttt{github} : \\
		\url{https://github.com/clef-men/caml5}
	\item
		Simplified Chase-Lev deque (one infinite array) \hfill \cmark \\
		Real-life Chase-Lev deque (multiple circular arrays) \hfill \ucmark
	\item
		Proof looks more complex than the sketch.
		In particular, transitions between logical states are not really formalized.
	\item
		We plan to verify more primitives (\href{https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/domainslib}{Domainslib}, \href{https://github.com/taskflow/taskflow}{Taskflow}) based on Chase-Lev deque.
		This is thanks to modularity of \Iris specifications.
